# Atom Elementary UI

This theme is meant to make atom fit in with the rest of Elementary OS when using both light and dark syntax themes.
In order to make it feel as native as possible, most of the styling has been derived directly from the official GTK theme!

The theme attempts to match the syntax themes background color.
